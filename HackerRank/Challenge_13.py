Task
Given an integer, n, and n space-separated integers as input, create a tuple, t, of those n integers. Then compute and print the result of hash(t).

Note: hash() is one of the functions in the __builtins__ module, so it need not be imported.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in the tuple.
The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the elements in tuple .
